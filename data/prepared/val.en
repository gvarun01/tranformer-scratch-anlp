Lastly, I would like to offer the following assessment. You may rest assured, Mr Fabra Vallés, Mrs Theato, that we are going to get to the bottom of this matter.
For the first time, trade union movements have succeeded in bringing thousands of workers out into the streets: that is a sign that should be taken very seriously.

Given that the Commission has updated its requirements for 1998 for compulsory expenditure with a reduction of ECU 329m, we believe that these appropriations should be placed in reserve, and secondly, that we should not have to resort to any form of creative accounting in order to remain within the 0.45 % increase foreseen for the agriculture budget compared with 1997.

Looking at the situation in Latin America today, it is obvious that it is not, as Mr Bertens said a moment ago, the same situation as in the last few decades. It is a much more complex, more active world, with good things and bad, but also with enormous possibilities.

Decisive factors here seem to be toe lack of further liberalization of the railways, the high costs of transferring goods from one form of transport to another, and finally, Commissioner - and I should like to hear what you have to say on this - the fact that it is impossible for transporters to take responsibUity them selves for transferring and unloading from rail transport at the place of destination.

The legislation of the EU Member States in this sector differs widely, and in many cases is inadequate.

It has held meetings yesterday and today.
Why should we be in such a rush at this stage to become involved in a directive which is going to be obsolete anyway in six or nine months?
The Western European Union needs to be integrated into the European Union if we are to have credible instruments for pursuing a foreign policy.
The Council's authority is strengthened to the detriment of the Commission's.
Similarly, the Commission is studying how the Phare programme can help to improve inter-ethnic relations, which constitute one of the most complex aspects of the domestic political situation.

On the contrary, the current policy has lent support only to toe large European organisations, often forgetting that it is in toe countries where consumer organisations are smaUer and weaker that they are toe more necessary.
We think it important that clear rules be drawn up on a EU-wide basis governing what can and what cannot be patented and that definitions be given of what constitutes an invention and what constitutes a discovery that cannot be patented.

Finally, I want to thank you once again for your report, which will allow us to identify the best ways to strengthen the social dialogue and to associate it more closely with the efforts to reach European Union objectives, particu larly employment and economic growth.
Lastly, a real solution must be found to the problem in Kosovo.
You say the system did not work, and I am asking you to explain why you think it did not work.
The 'Kleisthenis' programme forms an important part of the Second Community Support Programme for Greece: it is intended to modernize Greek public administration which constitutes one of the main priorities in Greek attempts to promote development and convergence with the other Community countries.

Even Parliament, to be honest, is sometimes guilty of this.
It is printed in the agenda as such but there seems to be a deal of confusion and, given the sensitivity of this issue, it is important that everybody hears from your lips when the vote will be taken.
Very briefly, how can we implement that coordination of economic policies without the instruments to do so?
We oppose restructuring and privatization measures and demand the maintenance of national capacity, which meets only 5 % of military orders, and its diversification into civilian industry, notably in the aeronautics, space and electronics industries.
That is the right and sensible approach, and Parliament must support the Member States' authorities - not only the customs authorities, but all the other national authorities involved - in their efforts to step up the fight against crime in this area, which is constantly on the increase; and we support all efforts to set up the necessary information systems to this end.
The Committee was for example informed of the conclusion of a cooperation agreement between UCLAF and the Guardia di Finanza.

Theorin (PSE). - (SV) Madame President, this is a good report that is being presented, the result of thorough and extensive work.
[Note on sub-para, (a) above : It is worth adding that a failure has been reported in advising traders in sufficient Ume when amendments are made to the ECU exchange rate añer the rate for the month has been set.
On the one hand the Commission points out that there are no great monetary fluctuations, but it also states that strong cunencies have been devalued while other cunencies have tended to be revalued.
Finally, it is true that more has been achieved as far as indirect taxation is concerned, but it is also vital to make progress on direct taxation too - and to make it soon in respect of capital movements in particular, as several Members have pointed out.
So what about the promises given by the Commission to the European Parliament when we were discussing ratification of the partnership and cooperation agreement and when the Commission was pressing so hard for Russia and Ukraine to become members of the Council of Europe at an excessively early date?
1 interest over the last few years. A major international conference on the subject was organised In 1997 during the Dutch Presidency of the European Union.
That is why Parliament is sounding the alarm and sending a vital poUtical message to the states, to the governments, to the Commission: where closer cooperation is necessary it must occur within the Treaty and not outside the Treaty, with the guarantees of the Community institutions and procedures.
The question is to know whether, when we hear so much about competitiveness, fair competition and protecting the weakest, there are or can be real objectives that can be put into practice, in the face of the polarization of means, even or especially those of commercial communications.
The Commission does, however, realize that the intention of these amendments is to strengthen the administrative . supervision of such high-risk activities.
His incisive comment accurately reflects what became of the desperately needed and much-heralded project of reform.
Only then can they expect the citizen to accept them.
These are details which we cannot expect to resolve at the moment.

The automotive industry - one of Europe's industrial mainstays - will have to undergo restructuring in the next ten years.
Debates of the European Parliament
I would suggest that we should vote on this point at 9 a.m. tomorrow morning, so that we can have time for discussion in the Committee on Agriculture and perhaps also with Commissioner Fischler.
My second point is that if we conclude a treaty, it must of course cover human rights. The EU cannot just fiddle around with protocols on a matter like this.

It is true that some of the negative proposals which were on the table were not, at least specifically, considered.
Mrs Green has the floor to move the request.
Because we all have our different priorities: for some of us it's the public service, for others the public sector; a third group is mainly interested in universal access, and a fourth wants to avoid inequality.
However, they have not managed to harmonize their Member States' air traffic control systems or increase their safety.

For all the above areas preference will be given to projects which include:
The current situation, whereby customs services look askance at each others' methods, operates to the advantage of the fraudster alone.
I also think it is wise on the Commission's part to place just the regulatory activities on a supranational footing.
The basis of the EU's cultural policy is still the protection and enhancement of cultural and linguistic diversity.
Why does no one ever say that we are
It is not up to us to impose any conduct as far as that is concerned.
Once we have arrived at a result the Commission will, obviously, present the new ideas to you, and perhaps you will then say: 'We are going to abandon the criteria of the Novel Food Regulation, because we want to say on the label whenever genetic engineering is involved, even if it does subsequently vanish somewhere along the food chain, because that is the existing situation with soya and maize.'
We are now waiting to see the results of this undertaking by the US administration, and if the Commission and the Council in any way have the impression that the American administration will not be able to fulfil the agreements, then we shall not hesitate to restart the WTO panel.

We are talking about reasonable organization, giving imports from the large banana producers a 70 % share of the Community market and keeping a small amount, 30 %, for Community producers and traditional ACP producers.
We have done some good work so far, but we must bear in mind that there is a great deal still to be done.
Other aspects, however, such as the period of validity of the passport its security specifications or even its cost, are not covered by the resolutions.
There is substantial demand for the products of biotechnology: demand from citizens, particularly those whose circum­stances are rather special ­ and this mainly involves the pharmaceuticals sector; and demand from sectors, such as agriculture, in which products of this kind could bring substantial benefits from many points of view.

Quite clearly, this goes against the thrust of this proposal, which aims to tighten the rules on admission and to exclude those operators who systematically breach or abuse the law.

The report does note that the United States' armament industry is protected in all sorts of ways which prevent full competition, but it in no way recommends a symmetrical attitude on the part of the Community which should, on the contrary, open up to the purchase of off-the-shelf military equipment in third countries and to the transfer of military technology.
These are obscure, metaphysical terms.
It would be very dangerous indeed to concentrate simply on growth and competitiveness.
Sandbæk (I-EDN). - (DA) Mr President, I too would like to wish Mr Whitehead well with his far-reaching report, for the most positive thing one can say about the Commission's statement on consumer policy, to be rea Us tic, is that it is far too vague and superficial.
It is all the more welcome, then, that some time ago the Commission again made computerization of the system one of its priorities.
We are also opposed to that.
We demand detailed information and the participation of everyone at the negotiations for an MIA, which has so far been at OECD level and will certainly later continue at WTO level.
So I think Members who have prepared speeches should regard them as explanations of vote and the vote should be taken immediately after Commissioner Fischler has spoken.

As I understood it, you are agreed that we should have them in place, so what progress has been made in the negotiations on coordinating views so that it will be possible to arrive at a common position for the Ottawa meeting?

There are currently two infringement procedures under Article 169 of the Treaty and, if necessary, the Commission would not hesitate to bring the matter before the Court of Justice.

In my view it gives the European consumer effective protection without at the same time introducing conditions on distance sales which would be so onerous that consumers would find it difficult to make purchases at a distance.

And the fact is that not only have disturbing events occurred in the last few days, but this is accompanied by a debate in France on the Debré Bill which is going to strengthen the ideas of an advancing ultra-right, of an ultra-right which is feeding on social discontent and linking immigration with delinquency in a simplistic and tendentious way. The challenge for toe European Parliament and the governments of the Member States is to take toe bull by the horns, abandon hypocrisy and double standards and, as well as condemning these threats to people's freedom, go to the heart of the problem and lay the foundations for eliminating the causes of this rise of intolerance.

Ultimately, this would help to raise the profile of lesser-used languages and also to preserve Europe's cultural diversity, a basic prerequisite for longterm intellectual competitive ness in Europe. Enlargement towards the east should not just be regarded from an economic point of view: the inclusion of the CEECs in EU education and training programmes is a key aspect of our strategy of eastward enlargement.
This suggests that this balance would in some way be threat ened.

The results from this project show that estimating the cost and benefits of OSH measures has become an important issue In most Member States of the European Union and that the attention paid to it is still increasing.
There is the other great challenge which has a clear European dimension too: how to accommodate the full implementation of the internal market with the diversity of all of the national systems; and how to better reconcile that diversity with both freedom of movement of people within the Union and the freedom to provide services.
The absence of any amendments to this report indicates the large measure of agreement amongst various political groupings that the best and most appropriate course of action is to refer it back.
There are reports of a major storage facility in Sillamäe, Estonia for waste from a factory that manufactured products containing uranium.
