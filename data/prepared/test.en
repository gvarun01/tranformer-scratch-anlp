As a Member for one of the most sensitive transit regions of the EU, the Tiroler Inntal or Brenner region, I particularly welcome the new and committed initiative towards com bined transport, as we have already heard too much said but seen too little done.

The Treaty on European Union has also extended this procedure to cover the uniform electora] law, the Sttuctural Funds and European citizenship.
At a technical level, discussions have already started with experts from Member States to discuss the implementation modalities of such a proposal.
The aspirations voiced in Mr Sakellariou's report are very laudable, but I maintain that they are not very realistic.
Kofoed (ELDR). - (DA) Mr President, first let me congratulate the rapporteurs on these reports.
Europe must reflect upon its roots and reject the coordinated irresponsibility of industrialists, scientists and politicians who drive people and animals mad and whose obsession with progress makçs them see opportunities in the cloning of living creatures.
In this regard, I believe the most essential single reform would be to end the process of tax erosion, that is to say, guarantee that producers cease to wander from one country to another in search of lower taxation systems.
Secondly, I would expect anyone who can exert any influence on those responsible for this conduct or misconduct to do so immediately.
Secondly, as has already been mentioned, we should urge people not to go on holiday to Burma, and we should call on all holiday companies and tour operators to stop organizing trips to Burma, because the hotels and all the rest of the infrastructure for the tourist industry are being built with the help of slave labour.
Perhaps you are aware that I too sometimes visit projects and give talks at conferences about telecities and suchlike.

INTRODUCTION
Situation of the Community Plant Variety Office at 31 December 1995
The question to which there should be a very clear answer, at least from the European Parliament, which is the only elected body of the Community and is considered, for that reason, to be closer to the people of the European Union, is: who is responsible for this unacceptable situation? The answer is clear to all: mass unemployment and the policies that cause it.
I am able to support Document SEM 2000, Commission Document 3 and also the rapporteur's conclusions.
I should say that there is a regulation dating from 1985, Regulation No 3820.
If that happens you will automatically open up economic freedom in China. In the long term economic and political freedom cannot be divided.
The broad consensus shared by both commit tees ought to be converted into practical action as soon as possible and be viewed as an important step towards freedom of movement.
OPTIONS FOR REFORM (V) - LEGAL SYSTEMS AND PROSECUTION 15.1.
It is crucial that the agreement that was reached in Dublin is implemented as it is written. I hope that all the people who signed up to that agreement, on the Pact for Stability and Growth, will honour it as it is written and that there will be no rearguard action either by members of the Monetary Committee or the Central Bankers or, indeed, any particular Finance Minister from any major Member State in the European Union to undermine the compromise that was reached in Dublin on that pact.
Firstly, for everyone, and particularly the European Parliament, to condemn firmly the savage conduct of the Kenyan police, and, secondly, for us to give Kenya every possible assistance to enable free and fair elections to be held in that country.
Colleagues, I submit for your reflection toe fact that we have under our eyes three reports on a delicate subject, three pieces of evidence that the Commission is continuing only to half deal with the matter in order not to
You are not the Europe of the fat cats, in which old­style capitalism has donned the mask of globaUzation and is on the march once more.

Many people not used to dealing with high finance find that when you start adding on the zeros and toe bUlions it is very difficult to imagine just how aU-encompassing this industry is.
There are still considerable shortcomings, both at community and national levels.

Commissioner, the new structural fund regulations must restrict the type of indicators required to the respective assistance objectives.
This leads on to the importance'of the local level. This shows the priceless advantage of combining environmental problems with the needs and features of local communities.
Christodoulou (PPE), rapporteur. - (EL) Madam President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for the proposal he has made and for the announcement that he is accepting these amendments.
A tragedy, but sadly nothing new: the whole of the 'eighties and these early years of the 'nineties have been littered with such tragedies.
I would also àsk you to bear in mind the fact that no objections were made concerning this vote when the Minutes were submitted for approval on the following day.
We must fish less - we know that - but we must also more than anything else fish better and to do this we must not only reduce capacity, but also and above all introduce some selectivity.

I think that this is interestingly innovative and might be an idea for negotiating future fisheries agree ments with a similar dimension and equilibrium.
The first part of our amendment is very confused because of technical hitches.
Thirdly, what governments can do is by its nature limited. The key to success in this initiative will come if we attract private finance.
Of course this will not happen.
But then when a country that has the Presidency and is supported by other countries tries to do something, the first problem is to get it through the Council, and if that does not happen then as in this case you find these two countries that stuck out theh neck are punished by the country that ought to have been penalised by the European Union.
Unfortunately, the report on K.9 has been presented so late that nothing new can be added and there is no room for manoeuvre before the Intergovernmental Conference revises the Treaty.

Following the Edinburgh Summit of the European Council in 1992 and in view of the priorities set and the principles of subsidiarity, the Commission decided to withdraw it from its legislative programme.
What we tried to do, therefore, was to table certain amendments which would make it easier to implement the Pact and which would make life easier for the Commission.
Mr Mulder's report shows that toe Commission's action was unfortunately also dictated by other criteria.

As I said in my statement, Laurent Kabila was sucked into the power vacuum which existed in former Zaire.
Furthermore, it is important for the Commissioner to reassure us that the Commission intends to keep faith with its own declarations: in particu lar I beUeve the Commission should immediately confirm that the cunent difficulties are due solely and exclusively to the fact that Turkey remains a country in military occupation of another country.
In addition the Baldarelli report allows for a 5 % margin for excess in relation to the MGAs intended as an incentive to bring young people into farming. That is why we support it.
It would have been helpful if Parliament and the Union could have agreed a position in time to redouble their efforts to achieve a lasting solution to the conflict - a very difficult matter - to be based on a peace process geared to preparing for free and democratic elections for the Zairean people.
Patijn. - (NL) The Council wUl undoubtedly resume talks on the smaU difference of opinion, because the disagree ment was about one small sentence, on the political declaration to prepare the structured dialogue.

Not with the idea that these firms can solve our problem.
From Parliament's point of view, the Irish presidency has taken an important step in the paper which it has drawn up for the Intergovernmental Conference. In fact, it has proposed a Treaty text that would make codecision the standard procedure for approving legislation.

Liikanen about this. Personally I would be incUned - although this is a matter for the Commission to decide - to take a decision today to approve this smaU reform; the views stated by Parliament could then be token into account when considering the Staff Regulations as a whole.
The opinions show that there is a clear distinction between those applicants whose progress until now creates the reasonable expectation that they will be able to assume the obligations of membership in the medium term, without excessively long negotiations or transitional periods, and, on the other hand, those for whom such an expectation is not yet justified.
But what the information society actually can do is to create easier access to what is perhaps at times rather hermetically sealed data. Here we should not reject new tools either.

President. - Thank you, Commissioner.
We can try to evaluate it, if you want.
I hope that it won't all founder in procedures, as did, for example, our pledge to repair a parliament building in Sarajevo, which has sort of become a monument to the impotence of the European Union.
It is important for the measures to balance Community protection and free trade with third countries.
It is now quite common to hear people complaining about noise of one form or another.
Apart from the fact that the latter is only indirecdy to do with the WTO Conference, and apart from the questionable consequences on public health of price cuts for whisky, rum, cognac or gin, I wonder whether the progress in negotiations in the fields of information technologies and telecommunications will re ally be advantageous to the citizens of Europe, to Euro pean consumers.

The customs authorities are required to prevent and combat offences against both Community rules and national laws.

If a complaint is wrongly deemed inadmissible, the citizen's rights are put at risk.
So I believe it is important that, as a sign of genuine friendship, Parliament should say these things to the Tunisian Government and authorities, so that our dialogue can be based on reality and not on imaginary situations or pious hopes.
